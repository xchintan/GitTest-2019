As I'm sure you're all aware" is how you say "one of y'all most definitely is not aware".
    just cc'd an executive and want you on record. 
     
    Such a dick move. I only do this if I’m burning bridges.



    I love when someone makes a request and CCs my manager.
    I always put them on my lowest priority rung and tell them so with my manager still CCed.
    "Sure! I will have the cycles to do this in about two weeks or so. Please file a bug
    tracker against this issue for me."
    Even if I could have easily done it today, they're not getting shit if the first email out
    of the blue, or an email where they already asked me to do something but haven't clarified
    questions I asked, is an email that CCs my boss.
    They think he cares and wants to please everyone. They'd be surprised.


Or when they try to call you or have a face-to-face conversation so there won’t be a paper
trail, then you have to hit them with the “per our last conversation” follow-up email just
so they know it’s real.
    
    "Can we touch base offline?"

    translates to "I'd like to verbally bitch-slap you in person."
    
    It also translates to 'I'm an idiot, and I don't want you to be able to prove it later'


    Way more frequently this. To be honest these days I'm wary of anyone who wants to face
    to face or phone call anything that should be done in an email.
    If we're doing some covert shit together, totally- I'll catch you on a 'smoke break' or at
    lunch or something- but for some real shit if you're trying to talk on the phone and it's
    not an immediate action point then sorry, my call sheet is full all week shoot me an email
    so I can prove it later.

    
u always gotta manually remove the "thanks" from your signature to really let them know. 



If im feeling extra salty i won't include my 'Thank you for your time, queen_pook' at the
end and i swear when i click send i can feel the impending reverberation of my actions

on a side note one of my profs sent me an email with a :) in it, fr u think i should ask
him out after i graduate?

    That means he wants nudes. Send them to him. No risk, no reward.

    I have a customer who ends all his emails with a :). Do you think... I should send some nudes?
            
            :)


My favorite is using, “please advise”, when I’ve pointed out what they requested makes no
sense, is stupid or unethical. 
        "Please advise" is office for "what the fuck do you want me to do here?"
